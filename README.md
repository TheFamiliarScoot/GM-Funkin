# GM-Funkin
An engine/recreation of Friday Night Funkin' in GameMaker Studio

Built from the ground up (with references to source code and other assets), and with help from the GameMaker forums (indirectly)

# Why?
Because I could. One day I learned GameMaker had support for .swf sprites and then I finished a proof of concept I had from a while ago.

# Features
- Most songs from the original game
- Week 1, 2, 3, and 6 graphics
- Supports multiple chart formats, new & old
- Ability to add your own modpacks & customize to your will

# Drawbacks
As of now there's no way to import external .swf sprites, so graphics modding is a little impossible without the source code - but you have it here so why bother?
Support for custom atlas sprites was worked on, but I don't plan on finishing it.

# Can I use this?
If you really want to, then go ahead. This is mostly a proof of concept with a lot of performance problems, so I don't recommend using it.

It's also heavily unfinished - there's a lot missing and it's based on technology from late 2021.

If you do end up using it, please credit me (and the other people listed) for it.
