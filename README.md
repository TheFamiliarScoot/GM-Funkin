# GM-Funkin
An engine/recreation of Friday Night Funkin' in GameMaker Studio

Built from the ground up (with references to source code and other assets), and with help from the GameMaker forums (indirectly)

# Why?
Because I could. One day I learned GameMaker had support for .swf sprites and then I finished a proof of concept I had from a while ago.

# Features
- Most of everything from the original game
- Ability to add your own modpacks & customize to your will

# Drawbacks
As of now there's no way to import external .swf sprites, so graphics modding is a little impossible without the source code - but you have it here so why bother?
Support for custom atlas sprites may be added in the future.

# Can I use this?
Yes! Just, PLEASE I beg of you give credit (and optionally to the original FNF devs)

You may use it to develop your own mods, but **I wouldn't recommend it.**
If you have a complex mod, **there's a chance of there being performance drawbacks.**
This is still mainly a proof of concept, so using it for mods isn't necessarily reliable.

TL;DR - You can, but why would you when there's other engines out there?
