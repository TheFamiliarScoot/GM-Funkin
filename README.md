# GM-Funkin
An engine/recreation of Friday Night Funkin' in GameMaker Studio

Built from the ground up (with references to source code and other assets), and with help from the GameMaker forums (indirectly)

# Why?
Because I could. One day I learned GameMaker had support for .swf sprites and then I rushed to finish a proof of concept I had from a while ago.

# Features
- Most songs from the original game
- Week 1, 2, 3, and 6 graphics
- Supports multiple chart formats, new & old
- Ability to add your own modpacks & customize to your will
- Hopefully simple multiplayer soon!

# Drawbacks
As of now there's no way to import external .swf sprites, so graphics modding is a little impossible without the source code - but you have it here so why bother?
Hopefully there'll be support for custom sprites from .xml files soon.

# Can I use this?
If you really want to, then go ahead. This is mostly a proof of concept with a lot of performance problems, so I don't recommend using it.

It's also not entirely finished - there's a lot missing and it's based on technology from late 2021.

If you do end up using it, please credit me (and the other people listed) for it. (I still recommend against it!)
