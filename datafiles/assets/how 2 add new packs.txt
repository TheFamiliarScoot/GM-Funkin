1. go to the songs folder
2. make a new folder, call it anything (doesnt have to be related to the mod lol)
3. open packslist.txt in songs and add that folder name to the end of the file
4. go to your mods' assets folder
5. copy both the "data" and "songs" folders and move them somewhere else
6. move every folder from "songs" into the "data" folder
7. copy all of those song folders you merged into "data" and move them to the pack folder you created
8. in the pack folder, make a new .txt file called "songslist"
9. add every song name to each line in the songslist.txt file (order doesn't matter)
10. launch the game and you should see your pack added :)
